# re-search

re-search is a web application designed to help Stanford students find and explore research opportunities on campus. 


## How it works

1.  A web scraper to automatically gather opportunity data.
2.  A Python backend (using Flask) to serve the collected data through a REST API.
3.  A React frontend to provide a searchable and filterable user interface for browsing the opportunities.
