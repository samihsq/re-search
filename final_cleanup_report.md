# Database Cleanup Report - Research Opportunities

## Executive Summary

Successfully cleaned up the Stanford Research Opportunities database, removing **177 useless entries** (12.9% of total) and improving data quality significantly.

## Cleanup Statistics

### Before Cleanup

- **Total opportunities**: 1,371
- **Active opportunities**: 1,371
- **Data quality issues**: Significant number of navigation elements, form links, and generic entries

### After Cleanup

- **Total opportunities**: 1,371 (preserved for audit trail)
- **Active opportunities**: 1,194
- **Inactive opportunities**: 177 (deactivated useless entries)
- **Data quality improvement**: 12.9% reduction in noise

### Cleanup Breakdown

- **Round 1**: 143 entries removed (10.4%)
- **Round 2**: 34 additional entries removed (2.5%)
- **Total removed**: 177 entries (12.9%)

## Categories of Removed Entries

### 1. Generic/Vague Titles (Examples)

- "Research"
- "Admissions"
- "Department Forms"
- "Program website"
- "Website"

### 2. Navigation/Menu Elements

- "School of MedicineToggle School of MedicineBiochemistry..."
- "Toggle" elements
- "Browse All Research"
- Navigation menu fragments

### 3. Administrative/Form Entries

- "Program website - Application Form"
- "Research - Application Form"
- "Graduate Programs - Application Form"
- "Pathways Programs - Application Form"

### 4. Policy/Procedural Text

- "The deadline for informing the program that a student intends to take a leave of absence..."
- "Students who elect to take a leave of absence for any part of the 2020-21 academic year..."
- "Additional Elective:Students must take an elective course..."

### 5. Broken/Malformed Entries

- Single character titles ("5", "6", "3", "2")
- URL fragments
- HTML artifacts
- Overly long navigation text (>200 characters)

### 6. Generic Department Listings

- "Department of Genetics" (without specific programs)
- "Biomedical Informatics" (generic)
- "Health and Human Performance" (generic)

## Cleanup Methodology

### Pattern-Based Detection

Used comprehensive regex patterns to identify:

- Generic terms without specific program information
- Navigation artifacts and HTML elements
- Administrative forms without real opportunities
- Policy text that doesn't represent opportunities
- Malformed or broken entries

### Two-Round Approach

1. **Round 1**: Broad pattern matching for obvious problematic entries
2. **Round 2**: Targeted cleanup of remaining edge cases

### Quality Assurance

- Manual review of identified entries before deletion
- Dry-run mode to preview changes
- Bulk deactivation (not deletion) to preserve data for audit

## Sample of Remaining High-Quality Entries

After cleanup, the database now contains legitimate opportunities such as:

- Stanford Undergraduate Research Institute in Mathematics
- Stanford Sapp Family CS Bio-X USRP
- Conference Research Grant
- Small Undergraduate Research Grant
- AA 199 Independent Study
- Aero/Astro REU Program
- Planetary Science Laboratory (PSL)
- Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship Program (SULI)

## Impact on Categories

### Research Opportunities

- **Before**: 991 entries
- **After**: 840 entries
- **Removed**: 151 entries (15.2% cleanup rate)

### Funding Opportunities

- **Before**: 166 entries
- **After**: 153 entries
- **Removed**: 13 entries (7.8% cleanup rate)

### Internship Opportunities

- **Before**: 154 entries
- **After**: 142 entries
- **Removed**: 12 entries (7.8% cleanup rate)

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Future Scraping Improvements

- Add validation during scraping to prevent generic entries
- Filter out navigation elements at scraping time
- Implement minimum content requirements

### 2. Ongoing Maintenance

- Regular automated cleanup using the developed patterns
- Quality scoring for new entries
- User reporting mechanism for problematic entries

### 3. Data Quality Monitoring

- Track percentage of useful vs. generic entries
- Monitor for new patterns of problematic entries
- Set up alerts for data quality degradation

## Technical Implementation

### Tools Used

- Custom Python scripts with regex pattern matching
- Stanford Research API endpoints
- Bulk deactivation functionality

### Cleanup Patterns Implemented

```python
# Examples of key patterns used
r'^research$'                    # Generic "Research"
r'application\s+form\s*$'        # Application form entries
r'toggle\s+'                     # Navigation elements
r'^the\s+deadline\s+for'         # Policy text
r'^\w{1,3}$'                     # Very short titles
```

### API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/opportunities/` - Data retrieval
- `POST /api/opportunities/admin/bulk-deactivate` - Cleanup
- `GET /api/opportunities/stats` - Verification

## Conclusion

The database cleanup successfully removed 177 useless entries (12.9% of the database), significantly improving data quality. Users will now find:

- **More relevant search results** with fewer generic entries
- **Better AI recommendations** due to cleaner training data
- **Improved user experience** with actual opportunities vs. navigation elements
- **More accurate statistics** and category counts

The cleanup process can be easily repeated as needed and the patterns can be refined based on new types of problematic entries discovered in the future.

## Files Created

1. `cleanup_database.py` - Main cleanup script with comprehensive patterns
2. `cleanup_round2.py` - Second round targeted cleanup
3. `cleanup_report.txt` - Initial cleanup statistics
4. `final_cleanup_report.md` - This comprehensive report

All scripts are reusable and can be adapted for future maintenance.
